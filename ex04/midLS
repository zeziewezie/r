ls -lt --ignore=".*" --format=single-column | grep -v "/\." | awk '{print $0 ","}' | tr '\n' ' ' | sed 's/ ,$/,/'

# Explanation:
# ls -lt:
# Lists the files and directories sorted by modification date (most recent first).
# The -l flag provides detailed information (including file types, permissions, and timestamps).
# --ignore=".*":
# Ignores hidden files (files that begin with a dot).
# --format=single-column:
# Displays the list in a single column format.
# grep -v "/\.":
# Removes entries that start with a dot in the directory structure.
# awk '{print $0 ","}':
# Appends a comma to each entry.
# tr '\n' ' ':
# Replaces newline characters with spaces.
# sed 's/ ,$/,/':
# Replaces the final space-comma combination with just a comma at the end.
# The command results in a single line listing all files and directories (except hidden ones), sorted by modification date,
#  with directories followed by a slash, and entries separated by commas.
